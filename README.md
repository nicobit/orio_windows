## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that follows the
[simple app state management
tutorial](https://flutter.dev/to/state-management-sample).

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.
